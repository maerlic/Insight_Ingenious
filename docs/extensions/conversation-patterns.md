# Conversation Patterns

Design custom multi-agent conversation flows for complex workflows.

## Overview

Conversation patterns define how multiple agents interact to handle complex tasks through coordinated workflows.

## Pattern Types

- **Sequential**: Agents execute in order
- **Parallel**: Agents execute simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Agents execute based on conditions
- **Hierarchical**: Nested agent workflows

For detailed implementation, see the [Extension Development Guide](../development.md#extending-ingenious).
