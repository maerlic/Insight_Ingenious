"""Test the AzureSearchProvider's resource lifecycle management.

This module contains tests to verify that the AzureSearchProvider correctly
manages the lifecycle of its internal components, such as Azure SDK clients.
The primary focus is ensuring that resources are properly initialized and,
more importantly, gracefully terminated to prevent resource leaks (e.g.,
dangling network connections). It validates the provider's teardown logic.
