"""
Tests concurrency cancellation logic for the Azure Search provider.

This module ensures that when performing concurrent L1 searches (vector and
lexical), a failure in one search branch correctly triggers the cancellation
of the other. This prevents orphaned, long-running tasks and resource leaks,
which is critical for system stability under partial failures. The main entry
point exercised is `AzureSearchProvider.retrieve()`.
